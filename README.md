# Packer

3D box packing web application.
Calculates number of boxes, which are needed to fill three different types of bags. I use the Guillotine algorithm to pack the boxes.
If you are interested you can read about it in the paper of Jukka Jyl√§nki.

## About

This is not only my first repository on GitHub but also the first JavaScript web app I have ever made.
Out of curiosity I have chosen to use ReactJs for this task.
Because of some issues while handling the state in the app, I decided to use Redux to do so.
The Redux implementation is actually pretty simple at the moment. I need to split the code
and use the Redux combineReducers() function, when I do a refactoring of the code in the future.

Now trying to refactor the project...
